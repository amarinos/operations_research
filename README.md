# Vehicle routing examples with google ortools

This repository was created to build an application that can model and solve Operations Research (OR) problems. Currently, the application supports following OR problems:
1. Vehicle Routing Problem (VHP)
2. Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)



#### Todos:
1. Need to add a way to consume the secret api key 
2. Create folder structure, splitting: optimisation, distance api, solving the complete problem


//will be added to readme in the end
conda create -n vhp python=3.8 anaconda
